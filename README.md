## RSS Reader
### What is RSS?
RSS is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.
### What does this program do?
This program is written in Java and its primary function is to show updates of websites by using their URLs. 
Menu option:
- Add URL: Adds and saves a given URL to a file.
- Remove URL: Removes a given URL from the file.
- Show Updates: shows the name of the added websites
- Exit: close the program
It also checks if a URL already exists in the file and internet connection because some of its methods require internet access.
